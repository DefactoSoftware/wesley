    'p1': '<p>Often we are faced with different situations where we have to make a choice.  When you can’t get everything you want, and have to give up one thing in order to get something else, this is a trade-off.</p><p>When you think about what doctors are trying to do when they treat you, regardless of your specific conditions, the doctor is probably trying to provide you with one or more of the following outcomes:</p>',
    'ul1': '<ul><li>Keeping you alive.</li><li>Maintaining independence.</li><li>Reducing or eliminating pain.</li><li>Reducing or eliminating symptoms of dizziness, fatigue, shortness of breath </li></ul>',
    'p2': '<p>I’d like you to think about how important each of these is to you.  Think about a situation in which your doctor could not give you all of these outcomes at the same time, so that you have to make a trade-off.  I’d like you to tell me where you would place each box on the scale of 0 to 100.  The higher you place the box, the more important the outcome is to you.  The only rule is that you can’t put two boxes on the same number.  For the outcomes of reducing or eliminating pain and other symptoms, I want you to think about what would be most important to you if you were having pain or other symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, or shortness of breath.</p><p>As you think about each one of these outcomes, you need to consider how important to you each one is regardless of what might be happening with the others.</p>',
    'rest': '<p>So by choosing one of the outcomes as most important, it means you would be willing to give up some of the others in order to get more of the most important one. For example, if you choose, “Keeping you alive” as most important, it means you would be willing to accept some decline in your ability to do your daily activities and some symptoms in order to live longer. If you choose “Maintaining independence, it means you would be willing to accept a shorter length of life and some symptoms in order to keep your ability to do your daily activities. If you choose “Reducing/eliminating symptoms” as most important, it means you would be willing to accept some decline in your ability to do your daily activities and a shorter length of life in order to be free of symptoms. How far up or down you put the box will indicate how much you are willing to give up one thing in order to have more of another.</p> <p>Take your time with this. You can move the outcome boxes after you have placed them. Do you have any questions? Let’s begin.</p>'

    'p1': 'The OPT (Outcome Prioritization Tool) is a conversation tool to clarify treatment preferences. The OPT consists of four visual analog scales each representing a different health outcome',

    'p2': 'By scoring each treatment goal, the patient expresses his/her appreciation for each treatment goal. Prioritizing between these four outcomes implies that the sliders of different goals cannot be put at the same height. So, by choosing one of the outcomes as most important, the patient is willing to give up some of the others in order to get more of the most important one. The result is a ranking in which the scores and their distances represent the patient’s preferences at that time.',
