Prioritizing between these four outcomes implies that the sliders of different goals cannot be put at the same height. So, by choosing one of the outcomes as most important, the patient is willing to give up some of the others in order to get more of the most important one. The result is a ranking in which the scores and their distances represent the patient’s preferences at that time.',
